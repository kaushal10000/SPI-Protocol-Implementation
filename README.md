SPI Protocol Implementation:

• Developed the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol in Verilog HDL for high-speed data communication.

• Created a full-duplex master-slave configuration utilizing four signals: MISO, MOSI, SCLK, and SS, to facilitate synchronous communication.

• Optimized the design for rapid data transfer suitable for applications like sensors and memory devices.
